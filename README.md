## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Sitsawek

- Thanks for popping by!
- An avid learner, bold builder, curious explorer, and driven doer with a bias towards action, I enjoy seeking and solving meaningful problems with data and technology while having fun at the same time. 

- I welcome you to join me on a learning journey! Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kennethleungty), [Medium](https://kennethleungty.medium.com) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kennethleungty) for a good dose of practical educational data science content.
- You can find my data science portfolio below, where every project and article was born out of inspiration, curiosity, and motivation. Feel free to reach out for a chat on topics common to both of us!

- :man_mechanic: **Currently working on: (i) Applied Generative AI Use Cases, and (ii) Compilation of high-profile ML failures: [Failed-ML](https://github.com/kennethleungty/Failed-ML). If you're keen to join me in contributing, let's connect!**
